# pixark
pixarkserver Docker

我找到了很多可以在Linux環境下運行的“Pixark”服務器，但都失敗了，所以我自己做了一個。
I found a lot of "Pixark" servers that can run in a Linux environment, but they all failed, so I made one myself.

在架設的過程中，我設法在steam中連接到我的服務器，卻發現沒有地圖...
In the process of erecting, I managed to connect to my server in steam, but found that there is no floor...

後來查了很多文章，發現可能是有未知Port未開放，導致客戶端在遊玩時無法獲取地圖信息。
Later, I checked a lot of articles, and found that there may be an unknown port that is not open, so that the client cannot get the floor information when playing.

所以我只好關閉防火牆...
So I just have to turn off the firewall...

如果有人知道哪個Port導致了這種情況，我希望能夠告訴我。
If anyone knows which port is causing this, I hope to be able to tell me.
